# KidZania-MS
Created different types of diagrams for KidZania management system. The diagrams use case,  DFD, class diagram, and sequence diagram were delivered through two milestones over the fall semester 2022-2023.

1.	Project Description and Services in Details:
KidZania allows children to exercise their natural tendencies to role-play. So, this project allows parents to track their children by video and allows them also to create an account for each child separately, with his/her personal info and interests. Parents can also assign children to a suitable roleplay based on his/her interests.
On the administrative side, the admin can manage roles where he can update, delete, or add roles for the children.
Regarding the reservation process, user can pay, or cancel a reservation from home without tending to pay visit to the place itself just to pay or cancel a reservation.
